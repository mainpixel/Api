Mainpixel Laravel Api
====================
Laravel API was created by, and is maintained by [Mr. J. del Luna](https://github.com/paperclamp), and is a [MainpixelV4](https://www.mainpixel.io) bridge for [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com). Feel free to check out the [change log](CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 7+ are required.

To get the latest version of Laravel Mainpixel, simply require the project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
$ composer require mainpixelbv/laravel-mainpixel
```

Instead, you may of course manually update your require block and run `composer update` if you so choose:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "mainpixelbv/laravel-mainpixel": "^1.0"
    }
}
```
